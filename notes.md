* Need to handle when ety entries have multiple ety's for some reason, e.g. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hap#Etymology_1. A simple approach might be to only process the first paragraph, as often the different ety's are listed in different paragraphs. Unfortunately, the templates given in wiktextract data are not separated out into paragraphs, so this would involve processing a combination of the wiktextract ety text (which does preserve the newlines) and the templates list. This can be done by using the expansions given for each template and looking for them in the ety text. In case a template expansion appears multiple times in the ety text in different paragraphs, can compare the order of the templates in the template list with the order of expansions in the ety text to try to infer which paragraph the template appeared in.
* When processing the ety templates, deal with case where there is a valid chain of derivs but there is a term amid it that doesn't have an item entry, while a subsequent term in the chain does.
